# Task 4.2 Validation Log — Extended Dry-Run Monitoring

**Validation Period:** 2026-02-12 to [End Date]
**Stability Criteria Target:** 5+ consecutive days (or fewer if stability proven)

---

## 2026-02-11 — ❌ FAILED (Does Not Count)

**Incident Summary:**
- **Severity:** 🟠 MAJOR
- **Issue:** Task Scheduler auto-start failed (exit code 1)
- **Root Cause:** PowerShell syntax error — orphaned duplicate catch block in `startup_script.ps1` (lines 79-82)
- **Detection Time:** 06:00 AM ET (Task Scheduler ran, script failed)
- **Diagnosis Time:** 30 minutes (06:00 - 06:32 ET)
- **Remediation:** Removed orphaned lines, tested manually, committed fix

**Why This Day Doesn't Count:**
Per Task 4.2 Stability Criterion #2 ("Zero manual interventions required"), manual intervention occurred:
- Engineer manually diagnosed the failure
- Engineer manually fixed the script
- Engineer manually re-ran the script

**Commits:**
- `f201dae` — "Fix startup_script.ps1 syntax error causing Task Scheduler failure"
- `1db23e4` — "Task 4.2 Day 1: Document startup script failure and remediation"

**Auto-Start (6:00 AM ET):**
- [x] Discord notification received (after manual re-run at 6:32 AM)
- [ ] Task Scheduler execution successful — **FAILED** (syntax error)
- [x] Bot logs show successful startup (manual re-run)

**Gateway Restart (4:30 PM CT / 5:30 PM ET):**
- [x] Gateway restarted via Task Scheduler
- [x] Bot reconnected without manual intervention
- [x] Reconnection logged
- [x] Discord notifications received (pre + post restart)

**Gateway Restart Task Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
```
LastRunTime: 2/11/2026 4:30:01 PM CT
LastTaskResult: 0 (success)
Gateway healthy in: 10 seconds
```

**Notes:**
- Morning auto-start failed (syntax error) — required manual intervention
- Gateway restart at 4:30 PM CT succeeded — both scheduled tasks now operational
- **Both tasks validated** — official Day 1 starts tomorrow (2026-02-12)

# Morning startup log
Get-Content "logs\startup_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').log"

# Afternoon restart log
Get-Content "logs\gateway_restart_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').log"

# Check services
docker ps

# Check Task Scheduler last run
Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName "task_scheduler_startup" | Select LastRunTime, LastTaskResult
Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName "task_scheduler_gateway_restart" | Select LastRunTime, LastTaskResult
```

## Issue Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Prevents bot operation | Remediate immediately, restart validation |
| **MAJOR** | Potential future failure | Remediate before Task 4.3 |
| **MODERATE** | Benign or rare warning | Document, monitor, may remediate later |
| **ADVISORY** | Informational only | No action required |
